# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
This repository documents my structured learning journey in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It serves as both a personal reference and a growing collection of well-documented implementations.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Explore core data structures and algorithms in depth  
- Provide clean, readable, and well-documented source code  
- Demonstrate practical problem-solving approaches and design decisions  

## Implementation Details
- The repository contains source files with internal documentation explaining the logic, trade-offs, and complexity of each implementation.
- Examples may be implemented in multiple programming languages.
- **JavaScript** is the primary language used throughout the repository.

## Projects
In addition to individual algorithm implementations, this repository will include practical projects that apply data structures and algorithms to real-world scenarios. Larger or feature-rich projects may be published as **standalone repositories** with extended functionality and modular design.
